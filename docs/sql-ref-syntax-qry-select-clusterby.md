The <code>CLUSTER BY</code> clause is used to first repartition the data based
on the input expressions and then sort the data within each partition. This is
is semantically equivalent to performing <code>DISTRIBUTE BY</code> followed by
<code>SORT BY</code>. This cause only ensures that the resultant rows are
sorted within a partition and does not guantee to total order of the data.

### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
CLUSTER BY { expression [ , ...] }
{% endhighlight %}

### Parameters
<dl>
  <dt><code><em>expression</em></code></dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies combination of one or more values, operators and SQL functions that results in a value.
  </dd>
</dl>

### Examples
{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE person (name STRING, age INT);
INSERT INTO person VALUES ('Zen Hui', 25), 
                          ('Anil B', 18), 
                          ('Shone S', 16), 
                          ('Mike A', 25),
                          ('John A', 18), 
                          ('Jack N', 16);
-- Reduce the number of shuffle partitions to 2 to illustrate the behaviour of `CLUSTER BY`.
-- Its easier to see the clustering and sorting behaviour with less number of partitions.
SET spark.sql.shuffle.partitions = 2;
                        
-- Select the rows with no ordering. Please note that without any sort directive, the results
-- of the query is not deterministic. Its included here to just contrast it with the 
-- behaviour of `CLUSTER BY`. The query below produces rows where age column is not sorted.
SELECT age, name FROM person;

  +---+-------+
  |age|name   |
  +---+-------+
  |16 |Shone S|
  |25 |Zen Hui|
  |16 |Jack N |
  |25 |Mike A |
  |18 |John A |
  |18 |Anil B |
  +---+-------+

-- Produces rows clustered by age. Persons with same age are clustered together.
-- In the query below, persons with age 18 and 25 are in first partition and the
-- persons with age 16 are in the second partition. The rows are sorted based
-- on age per partition.
SELECT age, name FROM person CLUSTER BY age;

  +---+-------+
  |age|name   |
  +---+-------+
  |18 |John A |
  |18 |Anil B |
  |25 |Zen Hui|
  |25 |Mike A |
  |16 |Shone S|
  |16 |Jack N |
  +---+-------+
